This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to null handling in JavaScript. The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers, but it returns null if either input is null.  The problem is that while functionally correct, this behavior can be unexpected and lead to difficult-to-debug issues in larger applications.  The solution shows how to improve the function's clarity and robustness.
